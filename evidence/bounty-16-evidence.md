## Notes

This bounty was created and completed by the autonomous bot before the audit trail system was fully integrated. The on-chain state serves as proof of autonomous execution:

1. Bounty was created by bot wallet `0x81Bf...129E`
2. A stranger (`0x15C6...3e7B`) submitted a valid claim
3. Bot autonomously accepted claim #68
4. Winner received payout automatically

The winner is **not** the bot operator - this was a legitimate submission from the POIDH community.
